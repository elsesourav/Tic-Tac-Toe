## How to Play

Tic Tac Toe is a simple game played on a 3x3 grid. Hereâ€™s how you can play:

1. **Objective**: The goal is to be the first player to get three of your marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).

2. **Players**: The game is played between two players. One player uses "X" and the other uses "O".

3. **Gameplay**:
   - Players take turns placing their mark in an empty cell on the grid.
   - The first player to align three of their marks in a row wins the game.
   - After each player has made three moves:
     - The oldest mark is removed from the board when a new mark is placed.
     - This ensures the board never has more than six marks at any time.
     - This rule prevents a draw and guarantees that the game will always have a winner.

4. **Game Modes**:
   - **Offline**: Play against another player on the same device.
   - **AI**: Challenge the computer with different difficulty levels.
   - **Online**: Compete against other players over the internet.
